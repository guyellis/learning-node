# A Different Approach

Take a break from the traditional way that we normally teach.

* Forget the Intro
  * Your audience wants to learn how to develop in Node.js. They don't want
  to hear that *Node uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes
  it lightweight and efficient* or that *Node is a platform built on Chrome's
  JavaScript runtime*. You don't need to sell them on using Node. They're
  already your (captive) audience and they're there because they want to
  learn Node.
  * Their curiosity and desire to know those details will come later once
  they've got their hands dirty with some real code.
* Build something they can immediately use
  * It's highly likely that every member of the audience owns a website or has
  an employer or client that has a website. It's also highly likely that they
  will want to know if the site is not functioning correctly.
  * Let's build, in a few lines of code something that they can actually use
  to help monitor the websites that they're responsible for.
* Build a client not a server
  * It's generally easier to understand what a browser does than a server.
  Why? Because everyone uses a browser all day long.
  * Writing code is not trivial. Writing a client and building on that will
  be easier.

# Who is this for?

* Anybody who wants to learn Node.js
  * You could go through the modules and try and answer the questions on your
  own, however:
  * It would be much better if someone took you through the modules and helped
   you understand the answers to each question.
* Anyone who wants to teach Node.js
  * Use this readme and the code in this repo "as is" to teach students how
  to code in Node.js or...
  * Fork this repo and build your own version.
  * Pull Requests that improve the course are happily accepted.

# How to use this

* Each module introduces a new concept. We start off by building a client that checks
  that our site is running. We add more checks. Then we add testing, mocking and code
  coverage. Finally we discuss tools that may help us.
* This readme will move you from module to module. Each module has some questions
  that we expect to have answered by the end of it.
* Based on time available any number of modules can be covered. It is better that you move
  at the students' pace rather than trying to cover all the modules.
* You should have [Node.js](http://nodejs.org) or [io.js](http://iojs.org) installed.
  (This will also install npm which you'll need.)

# Tested on

* Node.js
  * 0.10.36
  * 0.12.0
* io.js
  * 1.5.0

# Following along

Use one of these methods if you want to follow along during a presentation/workshop:

* Online at GitHub, this is probably where you are now.
  * Advantages: Don't need to download anything.
* Download the modules (and this file) as a zip file from GitHub and unzip it locally.
  * Advantages: No `git` knowledge or `git` software required.
* Clone the repo locally: `git clone git@github.com:guyellis/learning-node.git`
  * Advantages: Can see what changes you made compared to original.
  * Can quickly revert changes.
* Fork and clone repo locally
  * Advantages: Can push changes and notes to your fork of the repo.
  Can submit pull requests for improvements you've made.

# HTTP Status

A quick refresher on some HTTP statuses:

* 200 - OK
* 301 - Moved Permanently
* 302 - Found (Moved Temporarily)
* 400 - Bad Request
* 401 - Unauthorized
* 403 - Forbidden
* 404 - Not Found

# Modules

1. A simple client to check a site's status
  * Open the module-01 folder in a terminal window. There should be a single
  `check-site.js` file in there.
  * Open the file in an editor.
  * What does this code do?
  * What is the `require()` function?
  * In a terminal window run `node check-site.js`. (Note, sometimes students
  open the Node REPL instead of a terminal. If this happens then `node check-site.js`
  won't work.
  * What is the Node `REPL`?
  * What was the result? Is this what you expected?
  * What could you do to get the expected result?
  i.e. what happens when you open that site in a browser?
  * Why is this type of utility of value?
  * How can you check both http and https sites?
  * The site that you are checking in `check-site.js` is yahoo.com. If you're in
  a class environment and there are a lot of student and everyone is NAT'd through
  the same IP then Yahoo's attack detection may trigger and some students may not
  be able to get the expected result. In this case have them change the URL to some
  other well known site.
  * Are anonymous functions better than named ones?

2. Replace `http` with `request`
  * Open `module-02/check-site.js` in an editor
  * How does this differ from the file in module-01?
  * What is `'use strict';`? Bonus points if you can answer: What is `'use strong';`?
  * What happens when you run `node check-site.js`?
  * What can we do to address this failure? i.e. Why did `require('http')` work while
    `require('request')` did not?
  * What directory appears after we run `npm install request`?
  (Note: You can use `i` instead of `install`.)
  * What is the purpose of this directory?
  * Does `node check-site.js` work now?
    Does it return the same status as in module-01? (We'll
    answer that question in the next module.)
  * Why use `request` instead of `http`?

3. Check status of multiple sites
  * Notice the new `package.json` file in this directory.
  How can we create it? What is its purpose?
  * What happens when we run `npm i` now?
    Why didn't we have to specify `request` at the end?
  * If `request` wasn't already in `package.json` then how could we
  have added it when running `npm i request`?
  * What's the `^` in front of the version number for request? What
  are the other options?
  * Open `check-site.js`, note the requests that we're making.
  * Run `node check-site.js`.
  * We have 3 `console.log()` statements.
    * Did they print in the same order as in the file?
    * Which one responds first? Why?
    * Is the order of response guaranteed/deterministic?
  * Why are both site returning 200? In module-01 the http version returned 301.
  * What needs to be changed to get a 301? i.e. how is `request` "helping?"

4. Using modules
  * What is `module.exports` in `check-site.js`? Can it be set to anything
  or only a function?
  * Why doesn't `check-site` have `.js` at the end in the `require()` in
  the `index.js` file?
  * Why is `check-site` preceded by `./` and `require('request')` didn't need this?
  * Why does the `callback()` function take null as the first param?
  Why does it take a single param in the second instance?
  * Why split the functionality into a separate module?
  * What are the 3 ways of using `require()` that we've seen? i.e.
  Where do the modules reside and what do we need to do to access them?

5. Testing
  * Why is testing important in a dynamic language such as JavaScript?
  * What happened to the `index.js` file? Don't we need it anymore to run the checks?
  * Open the `package.json` file. What is the `devDependencies` section?
  * What is mocha?
  * Why does `scripts` now have `test` set to `mocha`?
  * How do you add a module to the `devDependencies` section with `npm i`?
  * Open the `test.check-site.js` file. What do `describe()` and `it()` do?
  * Why don't we need to do an `npm i assert` to use the `assert` module?
  * Run the test using `npm test`? Why does this work? i.e. How does `npm`
  know to run `mocha`?
  * What is `done()`?

6. Testing without dependencies
  * What if you were disconnected from the internet or your internet-based
  dependencies is down? How would you test your code?
  * Take a look a `package.json`. What is `rewire`?
  * Why are we using `rewire` instead of something more popular like `sinon`?
  * In `test.check-site.js` what does `__set__()` do?
  * What happens if we change the status that we're faking to something else
  like a 301 or 404?

7. Generating code coverage
  * What's new in `package.json`?
  * What is `istanbul`?
  * What is code coverage?
  * Why are we testing the `test.*.js` pattern and not `*.js` for `istanbul`?
  Why aren't we using this pattern for `mocha`?
  * Run `npm run coverage`. Where will you find the results?
  * Which lines are not tested?
  * In `check-site.js`, what happens if we change the name of the `callback()` function in the
  error condition to `callbag()`? Will the tests and coverage still run okay?
  (i.e. Do `npm test` and `npm run coverage` still run okay?)
  * What other tools can we use to protect against this?
  * How can we modify our test to check the error handling code?

8. Complete code coverage
  * Take a look at the new test in the test file. What does it do?
  * Run `npm run coverage`. What does the code coverage look like now?
  * What happens if we change the name of the `callback()` function in the
  error condition to `callbag()`? Will the tests and coverage still run okay?
  * Although they failed, was a coverage report still generated?

# Tools and Utilities

* How can I keep node and io.js up-to-date and easily switch between versions?
  * [n](https://github.com/tj/n) and [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm)
  are currently the most popular options.
  * Matt Palmerlee has written a [comparison of n and nvm]
  (http://www.mattpalmerlee.com/2013/03/23/installing-and-switching-between-multiple-versions-of-node-js-n-vs-nvm/).
  * If you are using `n` then you can switch versions using:
    * Node.js: `n 0.12.0` or `n 0.10.36`
    * io.js: `n io 1.5.0`
    * Check Node/io.js version: `node -v`
* How can I deploy multiple/different versions of my app on the same server
with different versions of Node.js and/or io.js?
  * Using `nvm` you can switch Node.js/io.js versions before running the app. `nvm` adjusts
   the `$PATH` variable so each instance will have a different `$PATH` value pointing to a
   different version of Node.js or io.js
* Testing
  * Mocha is the most popular although there are a lot consider.
    * `npm install mocha --save-dev`
    * `mocha` or `npm test`
* Mocking
  * Rewire is probably the easiest to understand if you're starting out
    * `npm install rewire --save-dev`
    * `var rewire = require('rewire');`
    * `var someModule = rewire('some-module');`
  * Sinon is not immediately intuitive but it's very powerful and flexible.
  Graduate on to this once you are comfortable with `rewire` and understand the concepts.
    * `npm install sinon --save-dev`
    * `var sinon = require('sinon');`
    * `sinon.stub(mailSender, 'mailSender', function (mailOptions, callback) {...`
* Coverage
  * Istanbul
    * `npm install istanbul --save-dev`
    * package.json:
      * `"coverage": "node_modules/.bin/istanbul cover node_modules/.bin/_mocha test/test.*.js"`
    * `npm run coverage`
* Linting
  * [Compare JS Linting Tools](http://www.sitepoint.com/comparison-javascript-linting-tools)
  * JSHint
    * `npm install jshint --save-dev`
    * package.json:
      * `"jshint": "jshint ."`
    * `npm run jshint`
* Pre-commit
  * `npm install pre-commit --save-dev`
* Update dependencies
  * `npm install npm-update-outdated --save-dev`
  * Use as first command in pre-commit section of package.json to make
  sure that all dependencies are up-to-date.
* Continuously run Node
  * `nodemon`
